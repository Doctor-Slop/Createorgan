# Createorgan
An organ for Create mod. Minecraft version 1.18.2.

Standard Usage Manual:

The Create Organ is operated in a similar fashion to a DAW, with music having to be pre-programmed. Notes are played by powering a redstone link with the block
correlating with the frequency of the note, these are found above each fluid tank. You'll notice that you're only able to play notes in C Major with the
blocks provided. Thankfully you're able to transpose the played note up a semitone by setting the second frequency to a birch plank.  

The suggested way of creating songs is by feeding a pulse timer into a pulse extender, facing a redstone lamp* with the link placed on it. 
The timer into extender setup gives you control over when and for how long the note plays. Repeat, with the timer reading from the redstone lamp.

Chords are played by emiting the signal that plays all the notes in the chord, also using links. The standard for playing major chords (with a root in C) is the 
root of the chord being played as the first frequency, followed by an oak fence. Replacing an oak fence for a birch one will raise the entire chord by a semitone.
Minor chords are played by replacing the fence with a trapdoor (replacing birch for oak has the same effect). Other kinds of chords have not yet been
standardised, knock yourself out!

*That's only the reccomendation, you could also set it as the note being played or the root of the chord you're playing.
